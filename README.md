# Foodie (iOS App)

## Description

Foodie is an iOS app that allows users to generate a random restaurant within their location. It provides the user with 
the restaurant's address, a menu and link provided by Zomato, and the restaurants mapview location.

## TODOs / What's Next

The next step for this app would be to add a randomizer based on select categories such as cuisine and restaurant types. The user would favor their preferred catergories and the app would filter for those categories and generate a random restaurant of that type within the users location.
